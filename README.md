<b>How to play:</b>

Use the wheel to change the direction of the submarine and then press the middle button to shoot.

Each jellyfish hit will give 100 points and getting hit by a jelly will destroy the submarine and you will lose!


<b>Installation:</b>

Plug in board to computer, go to directory with the makefile and type make


<b>Possible extensions for the future:</b>

Sound effects, and 8-bit music inspired by the Beatles song

Saving High-Scores in the EEPROM

Lives system so you don't lose right away

More interesting jellyfish movement

More interesting shooting (Explosions/shot spread)

Boss fights (bigger monsters of the sea that don't die in one hit and fire back)
